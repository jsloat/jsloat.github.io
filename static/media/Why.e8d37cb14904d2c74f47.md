# Why?

Why would you want to spend time setting up a build process and downloading npm modules? Why not just create a web app, which would be about the same amount of effort?

For me, there are 2 big benefits:

## 1. Easier mobile "apps"

If you, like me, have experience with JavaScript, but not with the iOS development stack, this is a much easier route to building mobile "apps" (obviously they won't be as capable as a real app). You also get to avoid all the app store hurdles and quickly prototype an idea.

## 2. Access to iOS APIs

For a long time I used iOS Reminders as my primary task tracker. There are some apps that add functionality on top of Reminders, like [GoodTask](http://goodtaskapp.com/) (it's great), but beyond that, you're essentially stuck with what Apple gives you.

With Scriptable, you have full access to your reminders; you can delete all of them, search for what you want, display them how you like, or even build a sync between Reminders and a 3rd-party task manager with an API (like [Todoist](https://todoist.com/)).

Same with your calendar, files in iCloud, photos...etc. Scriptable provides a bridge to data that is otherwise very locked down by Apple.
